# Huffman encoding 

*[Huffman coding](http://homes.sice.indiana.edu/yye/lab/teaching/spring2014-C343/huffman.php) is a lossless compression algorithm based on variable lenght characters using priority queues, stacks, and linked-lists.*

This program reads binary in from the input file, encodes it, and outputs it as a compressed text file, and then decodes it into the original file.
